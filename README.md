# RISC-V-SecureBoot-TinyML
This project simulates secure boot and encrypted storage on RISC-V to safely run TinyML models in low-power embedded systems. It showcases secure AI deployment (e.g., anomaly detection) using open-source cores, fully in simulationâ€”ideal for research, prototyping, and industry testing.
